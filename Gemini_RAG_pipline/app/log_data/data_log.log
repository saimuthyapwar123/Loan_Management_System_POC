Answer: Hello Galle Krishna,

Yes, you can apply for another loan.

Currently, you have one active Gold loan and one Education loan application which is in the 'APPLIED' status. As per our bank's guidelines, a borrower may hold only two active loans at a time. Since you currently have one active loan, you are eligible to apply for an additional loan.

However, please note that you cannot apply for another Education loan or another Gold loan, as our policy states that a borrower cannot apply for the same loan type twice. You would need to choose a different loan type if you wish to apply for a new loan.

If you have any specific loan type in mind, please let me know and I can provide more details.]

Answer: Dear Priya,

Regarding your loans, you currently have one active loan, which is your Property loan.

You also had a Vehicle loan application that was rejected. The reason for its rejection was that your Aadhar number is not linked with the bank. To resolve this issue, please visit your nearest branch with your Aadhar card to ensure it is properly linked with your bank account. Once this is done, you may consider reapplying for the loan.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.]
